# Advanced Guide

Everything the bootstrap scripts do, done by hand, plus GPU setup, display
rotation internals and sleep modes. Start with [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) unless you
know you need this.

## Status scripts

Three diagnostic scripts in `tools/`. Each ends with a warnings section that
collects everything that needs fixing.

**`sudo tools/check-status.sh`** — general system and component status: DMI and
BIOS info, kernel cmdline, VBT refresh rate, build prerequisites, DKMS module
state, thermald and iio-sensor-proxy services.

**`sudo tools/dptf-status.sh`** — DPTF and thermals: dptf_enabler and the
int340x driver stack, DPTF participants and thermal zones, RAPL power limits,
and the BIOS settings thermald depends on (CFG Lock, TCC offset).

**`tools/gpu-status.sh`** (as your normal user, not root) — Vulkan, VA-API and
OpenCL state and which video codecs have hardware decode/encode. See
[GPU and Vulkan](#gpu-and-vulkan).

## Manual install

What follows replicates the bootstrap scripts step by step, in dependency
order.

Examples assume **Limine + mkinitcpio** (the CachyOS default). On GRUB-based
systems, edit `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub` instead of
`/etc/default/limine`, and rebuild with
`sudo update-grub && sudo update-initramfs -u` (Debian/Ubuntu) or
`sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg && sudo dracut -f` (Fedora)
instead of `sudo limine-mkinitcpio`.

Both bootstrap scripts take an optional stage argument (`modules`, `sensor`,
`cmdline`) to run just one part.

### 1. Kernel modules

Four DKMS modules, in this order:

| Module                   | What it does                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dptf_enabler`           | Unhides BIOS-gated Intel DPTF devices; required by thermald   |
| `minibook_ec`            | EC driver: thermal sensors, fan, keyboard backlight, toggles  |
| `i2c_designware_spklen`  | I2C spike suppression; prevents touchscreen/sensor bus errors |
| `goodix_ts`              | Touchscreen resume fix and OEM config loading                 |

Each installs the same way:

```
cd modules/<name>
sudo make install && sudo make enable
```

Verify with `dmesg | grep <name>`. See [minibook-ec.md](docs/minibook-ec.md)
for the EC driver's sysfs interface.

### 2. BIOS tweaks

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#2-bios-tweaks). Required before thermald is useful.

### 3. thermald

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#3-thermald) for install and
[thermald.md](docs/thermald.md) for patch details and tunables.

### 4. iio-sensor-proxy

Screen rotation and tablet mode via the dual accelerometers.

```
cd iio-sensor-proxy
make && sudo make install
sudo systemctl restart iio-sensor-proxy
```

On Arch and Manjaro, use `make install-arch` instead — it builds via `makepkg`
so pacman tracks the install. Add `IgnorePkg = iio-sensor-proxy` to
`/etc/pacman.conf` so upgrades don't replace it with the unpatched repo build.

On Debian and Ubuntu, `sudo apt remove iio-sensor-proxy` first; on Fedora,
`sudo dnf remove iio-sensor-proxy` — so the distro package doesn't shadow the
fork.

Verify: run `monitor-sensor` and tilt the device. See
[iio-sensor-proxy.md](docs/iio-sensor-proxy.md) for how it works and which
desktops need a bridge daemon.

### 5. Kernel command line

Add to the kernel command line in `/etc/default/limine`:

```
video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=right_side_up mem_sleep_default=deep i915.enable_psr=0
```

Then rebuild with `sudo limine-mkinitcpio`. What each does:

| Argument                                      | Purpose                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=right_side_up` | Rotate the panel; see [Display rotation](#display-rotation) |
| `mem_sleep_default=deep`                      | Default to S3 sleep; see [Sleep mode](#sleep-mode-s0ix-vs-s3) |
| `i915.enable_psr=0`                           | Fix DSI link tearing; see [DSI link tearing](#dsi-link-tearing) |

### 6. Console rotation

Text consoles do not follow `panel_orientation`. Rotate them at boot with a
tmpfiles entry:

```
echo 'w /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate_all - - - - 1' \
  | sudo tee /etc/tmpfiles.d/fbcon-rotate.conf
```

Console rotation does not compose additively with the panel orientation, so if
1 comes out wrong, try the other values (0-3) rather than deriving one.

### 7. VBT patcher (display refresh rate)

Deliberately not part of the bootstrap scripts: a raised pixel clock can pass
a cold boot and still fail on the first suspend. See
[GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md#optional-higher-refresh-rate) for the quick start and
[vbt-patch.md](docs/vbt-patch.md) for the full tool reference.

## GPU and Vulkan

The Intel N150 has UHD Graphics (Gen12.2, Alder Lake-N). Run
`tools/gpu-status.sh` to see what is working.

### Required packages

On Arch/CachyOS (names differ on other distros, e.g. `mesa-vulkan-drivers` on
Fedora/Ubuntu):

| Package                 | What it provides                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mesa`                  | OpenGL and Vulkan (ANV) drivers for Intel       |
| `vulkan-intel`          | Intel ANV Vulkan ICD (may be bundled with mesa) |
| `intel-media-driver`    | VA-API hardware video acceleration (iHD driver) |
| `intel-compute-runtime` | OpenCL support (NEO runtime)                    |
| `vulkan-tools`          | `vulkaninfo` for `gpu-status.sh`                |
| `libva-utils`           | `vainfo` for `gpu-status.sh`                    |
| `clinfo`                | `clinfo` for `gpu-status.sh`                    |

### Enable Vulkan video decode and encode

ANV supports hardware video decode and encode (H.264, H.265, AV1, VP9) behind
a feature flag. Add to `/etc/environment`:

```
ANV_DEBUG=video-decode,video-encode
```

Log out and back in, then re-run `tools/gpu-status.sh` to confirm the codecs
appear in the vulkan section.

## Display rotation

The MiniBook X has a portrait-mode 1200x1920 DSI panel mounted in landscape
orientation, so everything needs a 270° rotation.

If your compositor consumes iio-sensor-proxy orientation events (see
[iio-sensor-proxy.md](docs/iio-sensor-proxy.md#desktop-integration)), the
desktop needs no configuration: the patched proxy reports `right-up` in laptop
mode and live accelerometer rotation in tablet mode. The static methods below
cover what a compositor cannot reach — the boot splash, TTYs and the LUKS
passphrase prompt — or replace the proxy entirely.

Static and dynamic rotation do not stack: the proxy reads the DRM
`panel orientation` property at startup and subtracts any static rotation from
what it reports. `tools/check-status.sh` shows the applied static rotation on
its `panel rotation` line, and the proxy logs its decision at startup
(`journalctl -u iio-sensor-proxy | grep 'panel orientation'`).

### Kernel command line

```
video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=right_side_up
```

The i915 driver applies a hardware rotation, so the boot splash, TTYs, LUKS
prompt and login screen all come up upright. This is what the bootstrap
scripts install. Rebuild the initramfs after editing.

The parser accepts `normal`, `upside_down`, `left_side_up` and
`right_side_up`. It compares only as many characters as you supply (a bare
`right` also works — don't rely on it), and an unrecognised value silently
discards the **entire** `video=` option. Confirm with
`dmesg | grep panel_orientation`: success logs
`cmdline forces connector DSI-1 panel_orientation to 3`.

**On an encrypted root, use this method even if your compositor handles
rotation** — the passphrase prompt is drawn from the initramfs, long before
any compositor exists.

### Text consoles

`panel_orientation` does not rotate TTYs. Use the tmpfiles entry from
[§6](#6-console-rotation) above, or `fbcon=rotate:N` on the kernel command
line (which takes precedence over anything the console would inherit). Both
need `CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_ROTATION=y`; without it the writes are
accepted and ignored, so check that and `/proc/cmdline` if nothing happens.

### Bootloader menu

Limine can rotate its own boot menu: add `interface_rotation: 90` to
`/boot/limine.conf`. Stock GRUB has no equivalent (checked against GRUB 2.14
— no rotation module or option exists), so on GRUB the menu stays sideways;
`GRUB_TIMEOUT=0` hides it on a normal boot anyway.

### VBT patch

`vbt_patch --rotation 3` sets the MIPI panel rotation in the Video BIOS Table,
making i915 treat the panel as already rotated. Firmware-level, embedded in
the initramfs, combinable with a refresh rate patch in one invocation. See
[vbt-patch.md](docs/vbt-patch.md).

### Xrandr

For X11 sessions: `xrandr --output DSI-1 --rotate right`. Runtime-only, does
not persist and does not affect boot splash, TTYs or the login screen.

## DSI link tearing

Panel Self Refresh (PSR) can cause DSI link tearing — the screen partially
fills with green and horizontal lines. `i915.enable_psr=0` on the kernel
command line fixes it (the bootstrap scripts add it).

______________________________________________________________________

## Sleep mode (S0ix vs S3)

The MiniBook X supports both s2idle (S0ix, software sleep) and deep (S3,
suspend-to-RAM). **Use deep**: S0ix does not reach its low-power residency
states reliably on this machine and drains the battery noticeably overnight.

Check the active mode (shown in brackets):

```
cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
```

Switch at runtime with `echo deep | sudo tee /sys/power/mem_sleep`. To make it
permanent, add `mem_sleep_default=deep` to the kernel command line (the
bootstrap scripts do).

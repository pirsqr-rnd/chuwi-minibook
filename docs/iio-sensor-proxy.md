# Patched iio-sensor-proxy

The MiniBook X has two MXC6655 accelerometers -- one in the display half and one
in the base -- connected via I2C behind a single ACPI device (`MDA6655`).
Together they measure the hinge angle between the two halves, enabling automatic
screen rotation and tablet mode detection when the screen is flipped past ~185
degrees.

Stock iio-sensor-proxy does not support this hardware. The upstream `mxc4005`
kernel driver claims the I2C devices but only exposes a single accelerometer
through IIO, which is not enough to compute a hinge angle. This fork adds a
dedicated MXC6655 dual-accelerometer driver that reads both sensors directly via
raw I2C, computes the hinge angle and provides screen orientation and tablet
mode events.

Once installed, the following work automatically:

- **Screen auto-rotation** -- GNOME, KDE, and other desktops that use
  iio-sensor-proxy rotate the screen based on how you hold the device.
- **Tablet mode** -- flipping the screen past the hinge threshold disables the
  keyboard and touchpad (via ACPI and `SW_TABLET_MODE`). Folding it back
  re-enables them.

The fork source lives in `iio-sensor-proxy/`.

## Install

The bootstrap scripts install it (see [GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md)); for manual
steps see [GUIDE-ADVANCED.md](../GUIDE-ADVANCED.md#4-iio-sensor-proxy).

## Desktop integration

The proxy exposes orientation on D-Bus (`net.hadess.SensorProxy`). How that
becomes a screen rotation depends on your desktop:

- **GNOME and KDE Plasma (Wayland)**: built-in. Enable auto-rotate in the
  quick-settings panel / System Settings. No extra daemon needed.
- **Niri**: install [`iio-niri`](https://github.com/Zhaith-Izaliel/iio-niri)
  and add to one of your Niri config files (e.g.
  `~/.config/niri/cfg/autostart.kdl`):
  ```
  spawn-at-startup "iio-niri" "listen" "--monitor" "DSI-1"
  ```
- **Sway / wlroots compositors**: use
  [`iio-sway`](https://github.com/okeri/iio-sway) (works on Sway, river,
  Wayfire) or an equivalent bridge for your compositor.
- **Hyprland**: use
  [`iio-hyprland`](https://github.com/JeanSchoeller/iio-hyprland).

The patched proxy reports `right-up` whenever the device is in laptop mode, so
the compositor applies the 270° portrait correction dynamically and switches
to live accelerometer rotation in tablet mode. A static rotation (kernel
cmdline, VBT patch, xrandr) does not stack with this — the proxy detects and
subtracts it, see
[GUIDE-ADVANCED.md](../GUIDE-ADVANCED.md#display-rotation).

## Lazy polling (`--lazy`)

By default the proxy polls both accelerometers continuously (every 50 ms) for
as long as it runs, so that tablet-mode transitions are detected even when no
desktop client is listening. This keeps the I2C bus and the sensors active the
whole time the daemon is up.

The `--lazy` flag makes the proxy poll a sensor only while a D-Bus client has
explicitly claimed it (via `ClaimAccelerometer` / `ClaimLight`), and stops
polling again once the last client releases it. This saves power when nothing
is consuming orientation events, at the cost of tablet-mode detection being
inactive until a client claims the accelerometer.

To enable it, add the flag to the service's `ExecStart`:

```
sudo systemctl edit iio-sensor-proxy
```

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/lib/iio-sensor-proxy --lazy
```

Then `sudo systemctl restart iio-sensor-proxy`. The path varies by distro
(`/usr/lib` on Arch, `/usr/libexec` elsewhere); `systemctl cat
iio-sensor-proxy` shows the current `ExecStart` to copy.

## Lid gating

Polling stops while the lid is closed (regardless of `--lazy` or any claim) and
resumes when it opens; tablet mode is unaffected. The driver logs each
transition to the journal: `journalctl -u iio-sensor-proxy | grep 'polling'`.

## Runtime requirements

The `i2c-dev` kernel module must be loaded. The driver finds the two MXC6655
accelerometers by opening `/dev/i2c-*`, which only exist once `i2c-dev` is
loaded -- without it, `find_accels()` finds nothing and the service exits
immediately with "No sensors or missing kernel drivers for the sensors".

The `acpi_call` kernel module must be loaded for tablet mode transitions (the
driver calls ACPI method `\_SB.ACMK.LTSM` to toggle the keyboard). If
`acpi_call` is not available, screen rotation still works but tablet mode
toggling via ACPI is skipped -- `SW_TABLET_MODE` is still emitted via uinput,
so most compositors still disable keyboard input at the libinput level, just
not at the EC level.

Neither module is loaded by default on most distros. Load them and add to
`/etc/modules-load.d/` for them to persist across reboots -- see
[GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md#7-iio-sensor-proxy).

## Verify

```
monitor-sensor
```

Tilt the device and watch the orientation change. Flip the screen past ~185
degrees and it should report tablet mode. The journal also shows debug output:

```
journalctl -u iio-sensor-proxy -f
```

## How it works

The driver polls both MXC6655 accelerometers at 50 ms intervals via raw I2C
(bypassing the `mxc4005` kernel driver, which it unbinds at startup). Each
sample goes through:

1. **Calibration** -- a 3x3 rotation matrix per sensor, loaded from the ACPI
   `GMTR` method at startup. These correct for how each sensor is physically
   mounted relative to the chassis. If `GMTR` is unavailable, hardcoded defaults
   matching the MiniBook X layout are used.

1. **Hinge angle computation** -- the calibrated readings from both
   accelerometers are projected onto the hinge axis using `atan2`, and the
   difference gives the angle between the display and base halves. The math
   follows the DSDT's `GMTR` routine (including its use of `180/3.14` instead of
   the true value of pi).

1. **Tablet mode state machine** -- the hinge angle is compared against
   thresholds (default: 185 degrees for tablet, 175 degrees for laptop) with
   debouncing. Transitions emit `SW_TABLET_MODE` via a uinput device and call
   the ACPI `LTSM` method to toggle the keyboard/touchpad at the EC level.

1. **Orientation filter** -- the display accelerometer's readings pass through a
   multi-stage pipeline (median filter, EMA smoothing, variance- based stability
   detection, gravity offset tracking) before being classified into one of four
   orientations (normal, left, right, inverted). A debounce counter prevents
   rapid flickering. The final orientation is fed to iio-sensor-proxy's standard
   callback, which exposes it over D-Bus for desktop auto-rotation.

   Outside tablet mode the classification result is replaced with `right-up`.
   The MiniBook X panel is mounted in portrait, so a compositor consuming
   orientation events (e.g. via `iio-niri`) applies a 270° rotation in laptop
   mode and follows the accelerometer once the lid folds past the tablet
   threshold. This removes the need for a separate static rotation fix (kernel
   cmdline, VBT patch, xrandr); see
   [GUIDE-ADVANCED.md](../GUIDE-ADVANCED.md#display-rotation).

   Folding back to laptop mode emits the landscape orientation directly, instead
   of waiting for the accelerometer pipeline to settle. Compositors that only
   rotate when a reading arrives would stay in the last tablet rotation
   otherwise.

   If a static rotation *is* already applied, the driver reads the DRM
   `panel orientation` property of the DSI connector at startup and subtracts it
   from every reported orientation, so the dynamic and static rotations do not
   stack. The detected orientation is logged at startup (`grep 'panel
   orientation'` in the journal).

## Known issues

Per https://github.com/fstanis/chuwi-minibook/issues/10#issuecomment-5690525031
there's [a known issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/4650) in
[Mutter](https://mutter.gnome.org) which applies the wrong rotation when
returning from tablet mode back into laptop mode.
